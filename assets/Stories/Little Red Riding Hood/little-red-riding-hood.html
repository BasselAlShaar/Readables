                                <p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.</p>

                                <P>"Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother cautioned.  "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."</p>
                                <br>
                                <P>"Don't worry, mommy," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll be careful."</p>
                                <br>
                                <P>But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother.  She picked a few, watched the butterflies flit about for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and then picked a few more. </p>

                                <p>Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>"What are you doing out here, little girl?" the wolf asked in a voice as friendly as he could muster.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>"I'm on my way to see my Grandma who lives through the forest, near the brook,"  Little Red Riding Hood replied.</p>

                                <p>Then she realized how late she was and quickly excused herself, rushing down the path to her Grandma's house. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The wolf, in the meantime, took a shortcut...</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The wolf, a little out of breath from running, arrived at Grandma's and knocked lightly at the door.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>"Oh thank goodness dear!  Come in, come in!  I was worried sick that something had happened to you in the forest," said Grandma thinking that the knock was her granddaughter.</p>

                                <p>The wolf let himself in.  Poor Granny did not have time to say another word, before the wolf gobbled her up!</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The wolf let out a satisfied burp, and then poked through Granny's wardrobe to find a nightgown that he liked.  He added a frilly sleeping cap, and for good measure, dabbed some of Granny's perfume behind his pointy ears.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>A few minutes later, Red Riding Hood knocked on the door.  The wolf jumped into bed and pulled the covers over his nose.  "Who is it?" he called in a cackly voice.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>"It's me, Little Red Riding Hood."</p>

                                <br>
                                <p>When Little Red Riding Hood entered the little cottage, she could scarcely recognize her Grandmother.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>"Grandmother!  Your voice sounds so odd.  Is something the matter?" she asked.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>"Oh, I just have touch of a cold," squeaked the wolf adding a cough at the end to prove the point.</p>

                                <p>"The better to eat you with, my dear," roared the wolf and he leapt out of the bed and began to chase the little girl.</p>

                                <p>Almost too late, Little Red Riding Hood realized that the person in the bed was not her Grandmother, but a hungry wolf.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>She ran across the room and through the door, shouting, "Help!  Wolf!" as loudly as she could.</p>
